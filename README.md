# nix-linux-setup

> Attempt to patch the Nix package manager

## Description

This installer only fixes UID (user id) ranges when creating `nixbld`
users.  By default the installer will assign UID from 30001 and
counting.  As it stands, those uid are not reserved UID for system
users (users that you shouldnâ€™t connect to).

The default Debian derivative behavior is to use the file
`/etc/login.defs` if configured or those values:

```conf
SYS_UID_MIN		  100
SYS_UID_MAX		  999
```

where `SYS_UID_MIN` is the minimum and `SYS_UID_MAX` is the maximum
UID for system users.  The starting system UID is 999 counting
downward (and until one is not already taken).

This is the only universal solution in order to hide the `nixbld`
users from the display manager login screen (GDM, LightDM, ...).

## Installing

First clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notetiene/nix-linux-setup.git
cd nix-linux-setup.git
./install --daemon
```

This script will download the latest tarball for your architecture
from `https://nixos.org/nix/install`.  It will also check its
integrity and it will finally apply the modifications to its
installer.

This script /should/ be forward compatible since it does not rely on
any particular Nix version.  However, major modifications from the
installer sould issue an error.
